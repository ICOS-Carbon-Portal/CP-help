Introduction
============

ICOS provides high quality observation data to develop our understanding of the greenhouse gas budget of Europe and surrounding regions. Main target users are the scientists that use this data in models. All ICOS observational data, from raw to final quality controlled observations as well as model results and the other data needed to feed the models are stored and published, and can consecutively be found and accessed through the ICOS Carbon Portal.

Which observation data products does ICOS have?
------

* **Level 0**: Raw observation data as produced by the instruments
* **Level 1**: Intermediate automatically quality controlled data, including Near Real Time data
* **Level 2**: Final quality controlled data, ICOS' main product

Which other data products does ICOS serve?
------

* **Level 3**: Also called Elaborated products. Data products in which ICOS data has been used to derive, for example annual flux maps for Europe or a country
* **Ancillary data** needed for the model, like land use maps, fossile fuel emission inventory data

How can I find the data that I need?
------

The data search is a so called faceted search. It can started from the `ICOS homepage  <https://www.icos-cp.eu>`_ using the **Discover our data** button shown below.

You will then be shown a further choice where you can select either **Observational data** or **Elaborated products**.

If you choose **Observational data** you will be offered a choice for which domain you want to see the data, as in the picture below, where we selected the atmosphere domain.

After pressing the **Find data** button you will be presented with the main search page of ICOS where your choices from the previous steps are preselected in the filter fields on the left. In the picture below we further narrowed our choice using the filters to limit to ICOS data (only from labelled=qualified and operational stations), Level 2 final quality data for the CO\ :sub:`2`\  parameter and for station Hohenpei√üenberg. 

The filters interact, when you narrow down using one of the filters the choices of all other filters are automatically adjusted to match the results of the changed filter. The filters are incremental, you can also select several items, like multiple data levels or stations.

The main search page can also be accessed through `a direct link to the portal search <https://data.icos-cp.eu/portal>`_

Note that you can save the URL to bookmark your search to look later for updates. These links can also be used in your own website to point your users to the most up to date list of specific data products. The Search above for example can be replayed using this `URL <https://data.icos-cp.eu/portal/#%7B%22filterCategories%22%3A%7B%22level%22%3A%5B2%5D%2C%22theme%22%3A%5B%22atmosphere%22%5D%2C%22project%22%3A%5B%22icos%22%5D%2C%22type%22%3A%5B%22atcCo2L2DataObject%22%5D%2C%22station%22%3A%5B%22iAS_HPB%22%5D%7D%7D>`_.

What other services does ICOS Carbon Portal offer?
------

We offer platforms for the scientific users to explore the data and to collaborate during the development of the models and generating the elaborated products. Examples are:

* Atmospheric footprint calculation (STILT tool)
* Jupyter notebooks
* File sharing platform connected to the data repository and Jupyter environment
* Mailing lists
