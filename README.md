# CP-help

Documentation for the ICOS Carbon Portal, for services that do not have an
associated GitHub repository. Documentation is built using the Python package
MkDocs, using the ReadTheDocs theme.

The ICOS Documentation Hub can be found at
<https://icos-carbon-portal.github.io/>, which features links to all of our documentation.

Within this repository, the documentation for the following services can be
found:
1. ICOS Fileshare
2. ICOS Mailing Lists
3. The ICOS Documentation Hub main page

## Developer Notes

Sites are built using `mkdocs build`. The contents of the `site` folder can then
be deployed to the correct directory within the GH pages repository,
[ICOS-Carbon-Portal/icos-carbon-portal.github.io](https://github.com/ICOS-Carbon-Portal/icos-carbon-portal.github.io).
