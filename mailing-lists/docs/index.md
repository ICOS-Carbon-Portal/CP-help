# Introduction

The [ICOS Mailing Lists service](https://lists.icos-ri.eu) is an easy to use
communication gateway for the ICOS community. Through the mailing lists, you can
reach targeted audiences and enjoy both moderated and unmoderated discussions
while using features like message digests or archive searching, allowing you to
keep track of discussions without clogging your inbox. At any time, users can
unsubscribe themselves or apply for membership of the email lists.
