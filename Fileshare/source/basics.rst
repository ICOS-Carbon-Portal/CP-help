In Fileshare there are different folder icons. Your personal folders are coloured plain blue. Folders that are part of a Group structure have a white group icon inside and shared folders have a white share sign inside. Please consider this when sharing folders and files from Group structures and only share those folders or files therein publicly where this is really allowed and useful.
