# Welcome to ICOS Fileshare documentation

## The ICOS Fileshare
The [ICOS Fileshare](https://fileshare.icos-cp.eu) is a service based on the
Nextcloud server software, and is a safe and convenient way to store your
ICOS-related documents and data! You can store private data, as well as share
data with other users and the world through a number of data sharing options.
The built-in document editor allows you to edit documents, including Word, Excel
and PowerPoint files, simultaneously with other users. All data is backed up
regularly and you can always revert to older versions of your files. Previous
versions of your data are kept until you run out of your storage quota for your
account or group; after that point, the oldest versions will be removed first.
Depending on your permissions, you can also get direct (read-only) file access
to the ICOS data repository.
