Signing Up

If you do not have a user account yet for this ICOS mailing list service, please click the Sign-Up button marked with B on the first picture above. Otherwise login by entering the Login button marked with A. And continue reading at the final section of this page.

When you choose Sign Up you will be presented with a simple form as below to enter the minimum information, including an email address, a password and a user name.

email address has changed. For the user name you can choose any string (no spaces and special characters, except '.' and '_'), you can always also login using the registered email address.
