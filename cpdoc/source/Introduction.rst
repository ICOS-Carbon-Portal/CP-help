The ICOS Carbon Portal (CP) has been developed on the basis of the `Carbon Portal white paper <https://docs.icos-cp.eu/share/s/xmbnuZz7Rg2N0DEB9DiaJQ>`_ written in 2012. The white paper document is available on ICOS Alfresco. 

CP was developed as the one stop shop for all ICOS data products, i.e.: “a virtual data centre where ICOS data can be discovered, accessed and visualized, and where users can also deposit data products based on ICOS data”. The data system is integrated with a metadata system that describes the data and its :abbr:`provenance (a historical record of the data and its origins)`. 

Furthermore CP provides capabilities for advanced web based services that provide researchers, general public and decision makers with useful higher level products based on ICOS data.
 
The basic principles of the CP are data security, long term archiving through a :abbr:`trusted repository (A long term external data archive to securely archive data)`, enforcing the data policy and user friendly operation. As a service to the data providers, CP will keep track of the use of the data and its citation. By default the CP supports machine to machine access to data and metadata. For human users CP adds user friendly web services on top for data discovery and access.
