The philosophy of CP is to treat all data objects equal and preserve the complete integrity of all data objects, so the actual data is never touched or changed up to the bit level. This goes for all data levels, i.e. from raw data, NRT data, final data quality controlled data up to elaborated data products. CP strives for the maximum granularity of Data Objects. 

The metadata that accompanies the data objects is maintained in a versioned so called RDF triple store, following the Web 3.0, linked open data approach.
